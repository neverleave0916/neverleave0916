- 👋 Hi, I’m @neverleave0916.
- 🌱 I’m interested in full stack development, in the production of my bachelor graduation projects, I was able to use Vue.js＋Electron for customized a FarmIn agricultural management system for the greenhouse in school.
- 💞️ For my undergraduate project while double majoring in Computer Science, I propose a thesis which speaks about Automatic Recognition of Broiler Flock Distribution with Object Detection and Clustering Technology.
- 👀 I’m currently studying for my master's degree in the Information Management Department at Sun Yat-sen University and joined Dr. San-Yi Huang's lab. I also participated in CSC's industry-academia collaboration to develop a event history retrieval system using NLP.
